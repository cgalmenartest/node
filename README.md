### Code Style

Generally try to follow the [Google Javascript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).  Spaces should be used instead of tabs, and the tab width should be set to 2 spaces.  No spaces at the end of lines.

### Commit Messages

Treat commit messages as an email message that describes what you changed and why.

The first line of the commit log must be treated as as an email
subject line.  It must be strictly no greater than 50 characters long.
The subject must stand on its own and not only make external
references such as to relevant bug numbers.

The second line must be blank.

The third line begins the body of the commit message (one or more
paragraphs) describing the details of the commit.  Paragraphs are each
separated by a blank line.  Paragraphs must be word wrapped to be no
longer than 76 characters.

The last part of the commit log should contain all "external
references", such as which issues were fixed.
