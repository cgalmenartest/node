  // The `port` setting determines which TCP port your app will be deployed on
  // Ports are a transport-layer concept designed to allow many different
  // networking applications run at the same time on a single computer.
  // More about ports: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)
  //
  // By default, if it's set, Sails uses the `PORT` environment variable.
  // Otherwise it falls back to port 1337.
  //
  // In production, you'll probably want to change this setting
  // to 80 (http://) or 443 (https://) if you have an SSL certificate
  // port: process.env.PORT || 1337,

  // The runtime "environment" of your Sails app is either 'development' or 'production'.
  //
  // In development, your Sails app will go out of its way to help you
  // (for instance you will receive more descriptive error and debugging output)
  //
  // In production, Sails configures itself (and its dependencies) to optimize performance.
  // You should always put your app in production mode before you deploy it to a server-
  // This helps ensure that your Sails app remains stable, performant, and scalable.
  //
  // By default, Sails sets its environment using the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
  // If NODE_ENV is not set, Sails will run in the 'development' environment.
  // environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'
